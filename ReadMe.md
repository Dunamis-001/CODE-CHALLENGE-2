Event Guest List Manager

Introduction

This project is a simple, interactive Event Guest List Manager built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to dynamically add, remove, edit, and manage guests for an event directly in their browser without page reloads.

Features

Core Functionality

Add Guests: Easily type a guest's name into the input field and add them to the list with a click.

Remove Guests: Each guest entry includes a "Remove" button to instantly delete them from the list.

Guest Limit: The list is limited to 10 guests, with an alert notifying the user if the limit is reached.

Toggle RSVP: Guests can be marked as "Attending" or "Not Attending" using a "Toggle RSVP" button.
Stretch Goals Implemented

Categorization: Guests can be categorized as "Friend," "Family," or "Colleague," each represented by a distinct color tag.

Timestamp: The exact time each guest was added to the list is displayed.

Edit Guest Name: An "Edit" button allows you to modify a guest's name after they've been added.

Futuristic Styling: The entire application boasts a sleek, futuristic "console" aesthetic with a dark theme, neon accents, and subtle glowing effects.

Technologies Used

HTML: For the basic structure and content of the web page.

CSS: For styling the application, including the futuristic theme, layout, and responsiveness.

JavaScript: For all interactive functionality, DOM manipulation, form handling, and managing guest data.
